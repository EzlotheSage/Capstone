      <h2>How to Play Munchkin</h2>
      <img src="images/munchkin.jpg">
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of Munchkin is to be the first player to reach level 10 by killing monsters, 
        leveling up, and acquiring treasure.</p>
      <h4 class="border">Components</h4>  
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Door Cards</li>
          <li>Treasure Cards</li>
          <li>A way to track levels</li>
          <li>Dice</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 class="border">Setup</h4>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Shuffle the Decks: Separate the Door and Treasure cards into two decks. Shuffle each deck 
            separately and place them face down in the center of the table.</li>
          <li>Deal Cards: Each player is dealt four Door cards and four Treasure cards.</li>
          <li>Starting Level: All players start at Level 1.</li>
          <li>Character Setup: Players can play Race, Class, and Item cards from their 
            hand to establish their character at the beginning of the game.</li>
        </ol>
      </p> 
      <h4 class="border">Gameplay</h4>  
      <p>Munchkin is played in turns with each turn consisting of several phases.
      <ol>
        <li>Kick Open the Door</li>  
        <ul>  
          <li>The active player draws one Door card and flips it face up for everyone to see.</li>  
          <li>If it's a Monster: The player must fight it.</li>
          <li>If it's a Curse: The player immediately suffers the effects.</li>
          <li>If it's any other card: The player can either put it into their hand or play it immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Combat (if applicable)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Combat Process:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Compare Strength: The player's strength (level + bonuses) is compared to the monster's strength.</li>
            <li>Ask for Help: The player can ask for help from other players (usually in exchange for treasure).</li>
            <li>Defeat the Monster: If the player's strength is higher, they defeat the monster, gain levels, and draw the 
              specified amount of Treasure cards.</li>
            <li>Run Away: If the player's strength is lower and they cannot or choose not to ask for help, they 
              must attempt to run away by rolling a die. A roll of 5 or 6 allows them to escape without penalty. 
              A roll of 1 to 4 means they suffer Bad Stuff listed on the monster card.</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <li>Loot the Room</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If no combat occurred: The player draws one more Door card face down into their hand.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Charity</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Hand Limit: If the player has more than five cards in their hand, they must discard down to five. 
              Discarded cards go to the lowest-level player(s). If tied, split the cards as evenly as possible.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h4 class="border">Other Rules</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing Cards: Players can play cards from their hand at almost any time, but only one Race and one Class card 
              at a time unless they have cards allowing more.</li>
            <li>Trading: Players can trade items (not levels, races, classes) with each other.</li>
            <li>Cheating: Some cards explicitly state they allow cheating. Cheating outside of this context is not allowed.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="border">Winning the Game</h3>
        <p>
          The first player to reach Level 10 wins the game. Level 10 must be achieved by killing a monster, not 
          by any other means (such as cards that grant levels).
        </p>
        <h4 class="border">Important Terms</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Levels: Indicate a player's progress; gained by defeating monsters and certain cards.</li>
            <li>Treasures: Items, equipment, and one-shot bonuses gained from defeating monsters or drawn from the Treasure deck.</li>
            <li>Curses: Negative effects that hinder players, drawn from the Door deck.</li>
            <li>Classes and Races: Cards that define a player's character traits and abilities.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 class="border">Tips</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strategize: Use cards wisely to either bolster your strength or hinder your opponents.</li>
            <li>Negotiate: Form temporary alliances to tackle strong monsters, but be wary of backstabbing.</li>
            <li>Manage Inventory: Equip items that give the best bonuses and trade or discard less useful ones.</li>
          </ul>
          Enjoy playing Munchkin and may you reach Level 10 first!
