    <h2>Review - Wyrmspan</h2>
    <img src="images/wyrmspan_pic.jpg">
    <p>"Wyrmspan," designed by Connie Vogelmann and published by Stonemaier Games, stands as a testament to the evolving 
      landscape of board game design. Drawing inspiration from the critically acclaimed "Wingspan," "Wyrmspan" introduces a 
      fresh set of mechanics and thematic elements that distinguish it as a standalone game while retaining the beloved 
      engine-building core that made its predecessor a hit.

      <h4 class="border">Game Components and Aesthetics</h4>
      
      The components of "Wyrmspan" are nothing short of impressive. The game includes 183 dragon cards, 
      75 cave cards, various tokens, player mats, and more. Each component is meticulously designed, reflecting 
      Stonemaier Games' commitment to quality. The game features illustrations by Clementine Campardou, whose artwork 
      brings the world of dragons and caves to life with vibrant colors and intricate details.
      
      The game's physical setup is flexible, accommodating up to five players with ease. The inclusion of three smaller 
      central boards, as opposed to a single large one, allows for a more adaptable gaming experience, suitable for different 
      table sizes. Additionally, the game offers natural rubber playmats and metal coin upgrades for those looking to 
      enhance their gaming experience further.
      
      <h4 class="border">Gameplay and Mechanics</h4>
      
      "Wyrmspan" builds on the engine-building mechanics of "Wingspan" but introduces new elements that add 
      depth and complexity. One of the standout features is the inclusion of cave cards and excavating spaces, 
      which serve as habitats for the dragons. This addition not only enriches the thematic experience but also 
      adds a strategic layer to the gameplay.
      
      The game also introduces hatchlings, which activate in three steps and offer significant payoffs, 
      adding another dimension to the strategic planning. The Guild Track mechanic, a later addition to the 
      game, addresses resource management issues and enhances the gameplay experience.
      
      <h4 class="border">Accessibility and Inclusivity</h4>
      
      Stonemaier Games has made notable efforts to ensure "Wyrmspan" is accessible to a wider audience. The game 
      includes features such as large font sizes, double-coded attributes, and minimal visual noise, making it more 
      inclusive for colorblind and low-vision players. This commitment to accessibility is commendable and sets a 
      high standard for future board games.
            
      <h4 class="border">Conclusion</h4>
      
      "Wyrmspan" is a remarkable addition to the world of board games, offering a rich, strategic experience that 
      builds on the success of "Wingspan." Its combination of beautiful components, innovative mechanics, and 
      commitment to accessibility make it a standout game that will likely remain a favorite among board gamers for 
      years to come. Whether you're a fan of "Wingspan" or new to Stonemaier Games' offerings, "Wyrmspan" is a game 
      worth exploring.</p>
